# MANUAL SPLUNK UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS

Since the Splunk Extension isn't available, here are 3 ways to get your data into Splunk:

## Method 1: Splunk Web Upload (EASIEST)
1. Open Splunk Web: http://localhost:8000
2. Go to: Settings -> Add Data -> Upload
3. Select "threat_predictions.csv"
4. Follow the wizard:
   - Set Source type: csv
   - Review settings
   - Submit
5. Search: index=main source="threat_predictions.csv"

## Method 2: Copy to Splunk Directory
1. Run this script as Administrator
2. It will copy the CSV to Splunk's lookup directory
3. In Splunk, search: | inputlookup insider_threats.csv

## Method 3: Monitor Directory
1. Create folder: C:\SplunkData
2. Copy threat_predictions.csv there
3. In Splunk: Settings -> Data Inputs -> Files & Directories
4. Add C:\SplunkData as monitored directory
5. Splunk will automatically index new files

## Method 4: Use Existing HEC (if fixed)
After fixing HEC configuration:
```python
import requests
url = "http://localhost:8088/services/collector/event"
headers = {"Authorization": "Splunk YOUR_TOKEN"}
data = {"event": {"user": "test", "threat_score": 0.8}}
requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
```

Choose the method that works best for your setup!
